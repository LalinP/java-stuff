/**
 * As we may infer from its name, we use PriorityQueue to maintain a defined ordering in a given collection:
 * the first element (head) of the queue is the most minor element with respect to the ordering we specify.
 * Every retrieval operation of the queue (poll, remove, or peek) reads the head of the queue.
 *
 * The Queue methods .peek() and .poll() operate on the item at the head of the PriorityQueue.
 * .peek() will return the item at the head of the queue without removing it,
 * while .poll() will return the head of the queue and remove it.
 *
 *
 * The optimal version is Quick Select:
 * It's a selection Algorithm
 * Will find the top kth element in a UNSORTED dataset
 * TOP can mean largest or smallest
